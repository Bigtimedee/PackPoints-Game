# PackPTS Project Context

> **Canonical project brain.** Every future Claude Code session, developer, agent, or AI tool working on PackPTS must read this file before making changes. If your work changes product behavior, architecture, schema, routes, environment variables, payments, fraud controls, marketplace logic, or core assumptions, update this file in the same session.

## 1. Executive Summary

PackPTS is a competitive trading-card recognition game. Users are shown exact digital replicas of real trading cards — vintage baseball, basketball, football, and hockey — with the player's name masked or blurred. The user must identify the player from multiple-choice options and earns PackPTS (points) based on difficulty, rarity, obscurity, card vintage, and player fame.

The game is not trivia. It combines trading-card nostalgia, sports knowledge, competitive real-time gameplay, a virtual-currency economy (PackPTS), a streak/reward system, and an affiliate marketplace where users can spend earned or purchased points toward real cards on eBay and Goldin Auctions.

**Stack:** React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (frontend) · Express.js + TypeScript (backend) · PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (database) · WebSocket via `ws` (real-time) · Stripe (payments) · WorkOS (OAuth) · CardHedge API (card catalog) · Railway (hosting).

**Scale:** 144+ database tables, 30+ client pages, 100+ API endpoints, real-time 1v1 multiplayer, an admin dashboard with 20+ views, a fraud/risk pipeline, a wallet with append-only ledger, FIFO point-bucket expiration, affiliate marketplace with margin controls, and an autonomous social-media growth agent.

## 2. Product Thesis

Trading cards are one of the most emotionally resonant collectible categories in the world. Hundreds of millions of people grew up opening packs, memorizing player stats, and trading cards with friends. PackPTS taps that nostalgia and transforms it into a competitive, mobile-first game.

**Why this works:**
- The card itself is the emotional center. Seeing a real 1987 Topps card triggers instant recognition and delight.
- Name-masking creates a genuine knowledge challenge — not a generic quiz.
- Points create engagement loops: earn, accumulate, redeem, compete.
- The marketplace connects gameplay to real commerce — users see cards related to what they just played and can use points toward buying them.
- 1v1 matches and daily challenges create social competition and retention.
- The Founders Pass / waitlist / invite system creates exclusivity during early growth.

**Commercial thesis:** Users play free → earn points → want more points → buy bundles → spend points in marketplace (eBay/Goldin affiliate) → PackPTS earns affiliate commissions and retains margin on point sales. Subscriptions add recurring revenue. Mobile (iOS) will add IAP revenue.

## 3. Core User Experience

### Account Creation
1. User visits packpts.com or receives a Founders Pass / invite link.
2. Signup requires username, email, password. Invite code may be required if the founders cap is active.
3. WorkOS SSO (Google, etc.) is an alternative auth path.
4. After signup, the user lands on the home page and can immediately play a solo game.

### First Game
1. User selects a game mode (Solo is the default entry point).
2. Chooses a card set (e.g., 1987 Topps Baseball) and number of cards (5, 10, 15, or 20).
3. A card is displayed with the player name masked (blurred/pixelated regions on the card image).
4. Four answer choices are presented.
5. User selects an answer. Correct = PackPTS awarded (animated breakdown showing fame, vintage multiplier, rarity multiplier). Incorrect = 0 points.
6. After all cards, a results screen shows score, accuracy, streak milestones, and a share button.
7. If unauthenticated, a signup modal prompts the user to save their score.

### Ongoing Engagement
- **Daily 5 Challenge:** Same 5 cards for all users each day, with a daily leaderboard.
- **1v1 Friend Match:** Create a lobby with a 6-character join code, share with a friend, compete in real-time via WebSocket.
- **1v1 Random Match:** Join a matchmaking queue, get paired with a random opponent.
- **Streaks:** Daily play maintains a streak; milestones grant bonus points; freeze tokens protect streaks.
- **Leaderboard:** Global all-time and daily rankings.
- **Marketplace:** Browse eBay/Goldin listings contextually matched to gameplay; redeem PackPTS as discounts.
- **Store:** Purchase PackPTS bundles or subscriptions via Stripe.
- **Profile:** View stats, level, achievements, Founders Pass status, streak calendar.

## 4. Core Gameplay Loop

```
Select Mode → Receive Card (masked) → View Answer Options → Submit Answer
     ↓                                                           ↓
  Choose set/count                                    Correct? → Award PackPTS
                                                      Wrong?  → 0 points
     ↓                                                           ↓
  Next Card ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
     ↓ (last card)
  Results Screen → Update wallet, stats, leaderboard, streak

```

**Key invariants:**
- The player name is never visible before the answer is submitted.
- Points are calculated server-side using the reward engine (fame score, vintage multiplier, rarity multiplier, policy caps).
- Each answer submission is idempotent (unique constraint on matchId + userId + questionIndex).
- Daily and per-match point caps are enforced server-side.

## 5. Game Modes

### Solo Play
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Flow:** Select card set → select card count (5/10/15/20) → play through cards → results screen
- **Scoring:** Server-side reward engine; base points inversely proportional to player fame; vintage and rarity multipliers applied; per-match cap of 1,000 pts; daily cap of 5,000 pts (configurable via `rewardPolicy` table)
- **Fairness:** Answer options are generated server-side from the card set's player pool; 4 choices per question
- **Known gaps:** No adaptive difficulty (ELO-based card selection is planned, not implemented)

### Daily 5 Challenge
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Flow:** Once per day, all users get the same 5 cards. Play, submit scores, see daily leaderboard.
- **Scoring:** Same reward engine; max 250 pts per Daily 5 session (configurable via `DAILY5_MAX_POINTS`); minimum answer time of 15s enforced to prevent botting
- **Fairness:** Same cards for everyone; new-account detection (accounts < 7 days old may have restrictions)
- **Known gaps:** Timezone handling for "day" boundary uses `DAILY5_TZ` (defaults to America/New_York)

### 1v1 Friend Match
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Flow:** Host creates lobby → gets 6-char join code → shares with friend → friend joins → host starts match → both play same cards in real-time via WebSocket → results
- **Scoring:** Both players see the same questions. Points are awarded per correct answer. Winner determined by score (or correct count as tiebreaker).
- **Real-time:** WebSocket messages: `start_match`, `submit_answer`, `ready_next`, `match_resync`, `rematch_vote`
- **Battle Sessions:** Multiple consecutive matches tracked as a series (wins/losses/ties across rematches)
- **Known gaps:** Host disconnect has 30s grace period; guest disconnect is immediate leave

### 1v1 Random Match
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Flow:** User joins matchmaking queue → paired with random opponent → match plays identically to friend match
- **Fairness:** No ELO-based matchmaking yet. `playerRatings` table exists with ELO fields (default 1200, tiers: BRONZE through LEGEND) but matchmaking does not filter by rating.
- **Known gaps:** Queue may have low population; no timeout/fallback to AI opponent

### Wager Matches
- **Status:** In progress (not complete)
- **Flow:** Lobbies and matches have a `wagerAmount` field. `POST /api/wager/validate` exists. `wagerSettled` boolean on matches.
- **Known gaps:** Full wager settlement logic and UI are still in progress. Do not treat as a working feature.

### Tournament / Pack-Opening
- **Status:** Not implemented (UI shows "coming soon" badge on home page)
- **Planned:** Tournament brackets, pack-opening card-reveal animations

## 6. Card Data Model and Content Rules

### Primary Card Tables

**`playableCards`** — The active card table for gameplay (imported from CardHedge API)
| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| id | varchar PK | UUID |
| gameSetId | FK → gameSets | Which card set this belongs to |
| cardhedgeCardId | text, unique | External ID from CardHedge |
| description | text | Full card description |
| player | text | Player name (used for answer matching) |
| set | text | Card set name |
| number | text | Card number in set |
| variant | text | Card variant (base, refractor, etc.) |
| imageUrl | text | URL to card image |
| category | text | Sport category |
| rookie | boolean | Rookie card flag |
| isPlayable | boolean | Whether card is active for gameplay |
| blockedReason | text | Why card was disabled |
| imageReviewStatus | varchar | unreviewed / reported / approved / rejected |
| reportCount | integer | User reports count |
| imageRotation | integer | 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees |
| quarantineStatus | varchar | OK / SUSPECT_TRANSIENT / SUSPECT_PERSISTENT / QUARANTINED_ADMIN_REVIEW |
| contentVerified | boolean | Admin content verification |
| validationFailCount | integer | Image URL validation failures |
| rawImagesOnly | boolean | Whether to use raw (unprocessed) images |

**`baseballCards`** — Legacy card table (effectively dead for active gameplay; exists only as a fallback if `playableCards` is empty, for backward compatibility, and for legacy admin image validation. Candidate for deprecation — but fallback code paths in `matchService.ts`, `maskingService.ts`, and `storage.ts` should remain defensive until removal is deliberate.)
| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| id | varchar PK | UUID |
| playerName | text | Player name |
| team | text | Team name |
| position | text | Player position |
| year | integer | Card year |
| setName | text | Card set |
| cardNumber | text | Card number |
| imageUrl | text | Card image URL |
| popularity | integer | 0-100 popularity score |
| isPlayable | boolean | Active flag |
| imageVerified | boolean | Image verification status |

**`gameSets`** — Card set definitions
| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| id | varchar PK | UUID |
| sport | text | baseball, basketball, football, hockey |
| brand | text | Card manufacturer (Topps, Fleer, etc.) |
| year | integer | Card year |
| setName | text | Set name |
| league | text | League (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) |
| isActive | boolean | Whether set is available for play |
| marketplaceKeywords | jsonb | Keywords for marketplace matching |
| cardhedgeSetQuery | text | Query string for CardHedge import |
| cardsImportedCount | integer | Cards imported from CardHedge |

### Content Rules
- Card images are sourced from CardHedge API and served via their CDN URLs.
- Images are validated on a 6-hour cycle: URL accessibility, content-type checks, color diversity analysis (detects blank/placeholder images).
- Cards with failed validation are quarantined progressively: OK → SUSPECT_TRANSIENT → SUSPECT_PERSISTENT → QUARANTINED_ADMIN_REVIEW.
- Users can report cards (wrong sport, wrong player, bad image, upside down, multi-player). Reports increment `reportCount` and are reviewable in admin.
- Card images may need rotation (stored in `imageRotation`).
- `rawImagesOnly` flag controls whether to use raw vs. processed card images from CardHedge.

### Planned Fields (not yet in schema)
- Explicit difficulty score per card
- Machine-learning-derived masking difficulty rating
- Card condition/grade metadata

## 7. Name Masking and Anti-Spoiler Rules

### ⚠️ MISSION CRITICAL — READ THIS SECTION BEFORE TOUCHING CARD DISPLAY CODE ⚠️

The entire game depends on the player not knowing who is on the card before submitting their answer. Any leak — visual, textual, or metadata — destroys the gameplay experience.

### How Masking Works Today
- **Client-side canvas masking:** The `MaskedCardImage` component applies blur/pixelate effects to configurable rectangular regions on the card image. Mask regions are defined per card set in the `cardSetMasks` table.
- **Image validation:** Canvas-based analysis checks color diversity and dominant color percentage to detect blank/silhouette placeholder images that shouldn't be served.
- **Card replacement:** If an image fails to load or is detected as a placeholder, the client requests a replacement card from the server (`POST /api/game/session/:id/replace-card` or WebSocket `question_replace_request`). Maximum 2 replacements before skipping.

### What Must NEVER Happen
1. **Player name visible in card image** before answer submission (masking regions must fully cover all name text on the card).
2. **Player name in image filename or URL** accessible to client before answer submission.
3. **Player name in API response** for the question payload before answer submission — the `correctAnswer` field must not be sent to the client until after the answer is submitted.
4. **Player name in HTML alt text, title, aria-label**, or any other DOM attribute.
5. **Player name in browser network tab** (API responses for questions must not include the answer).
6. **Player name in console logs** on the client side.
7. **Player name derivable from answer option ordering** (options must be randomized).

### Where Leaks Can Occur
- Card image URL containing the player name (e.g., `/images/mike-trout-1987-topps.jpg`)
- API response for "get next question" including the correct answer
- Client-side state or React Query cache exposing answer data
- Image EXIF metadata containing player info
- Card set masking regions not covering the name on certain card layouts
- Browser accessibility tree exposing hidden text

### Required Safeguards
- Server must send questions with answer choices but NOT identify which is correct until after submission.
- Mask regions must be verified per card set — different sets have names in different positions.
- Any new card set import must include mask configuration before cards become playable.
- Image URLs should be opaque (CardHedge IDs, not player-name-based filenames).

### Test Cases Future Agents Must Run Before Changing Card Display Logic
1. Load a game and inspect the network tab — verify no API response contains the correct answer before submission.
2. Inspect the DOM — verify no element contains the player name before answer submission.
3. Verify mask regions fully cover the name area for each active card set.
4. Test card replacement flow — verify replacement card also has proper masking.
5. Test with browser dev tools — verify no console output reveals the answer.
6. Test image loading failure path — verify fallback/skip behavior doesn't reveal the answer.

## 8. Scoring and PackPTS Economy

### How Points Are Earned

Points are calculated by the **reward engine** (`server/services/rewardEngine.ts`) using a policy-driven system stored in the `rewardPolicy` table.

**Formula:**
```
basePts = minPts + (maxPts - minPts) × (1 - fameScore)^gamma
vintageMultiplier = lookup by card year (pre-1980: 1.15, 1980-1999: 1.10, 2000-2019: 1.0, 2020+: 0.9)
rarityMultiplier = lookup by card variant (base: 1.0, SP: 1.3, etc.)
finalPts = min(basePts × vintageMultiplier × rarityMultiplier, maxAwardCap)
```

**Default policy values:**
| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| minPts | 100 | Minimum points for a correct answer (famous player) |
| maxPts | 200 | Maximum points for a correct answer (obscure player) |
| gamma | 2.0 | Curve steepness for fame-to-points mapping |
| maxAwardCap | 250 | Hard cap per single answer |
| dailyPointsCap | 5,000 | Maximum points earnable per day through gameplay |
| perMatchPointsCap | 1,000 | Maximum points earnable in a single match |

### Fame Score
- Stored in `playerFame` table per player (0.0 to 1.0 scale).
- Higher fame = fewer points (Mike Trout ≈ 0.9 fame → ~100 pts; obscure 1950s player ≈ 0.1 fame → ~180 pts).
- Fame scores are derived from `internalPlayerStats` (attempt/correct ratios across all users) and external sources.
- Default fame if unknown: 0.5.

### Streaks
- Daily play streaks tracked in `streakState` table.
- Configurable reward schedule in `streakRewardConfig` (JSON schedule of points per streak day + milestone bonuses).
- Streak freeze tokens can be purchased with PackPTS to protect a streak.
- Streak claims are append-only (`streakClaimLog`) with idempotency keys.

### Daily Caps
- **Gameplay rewards:** `rewardPolicy.dailyPointsCap` (default 5,000)
- **Streak rewards:** `streakRewardConfig.dailyCap` (default 250)
- **Card answers per day:** `DAILY_GAMEPLAY_BASE.CARDS_MAX_PER_DAY` = 200
- **Daily 5 max:** 250 pts per session
- Enforcement: `userPointsCounters` table tracks `pointsAwardedToday` per user per date.

### Abuse Prevention (Implemented)
- Rate limiting on answer submissions (3 answers per 2 seconds per user)
- Match tokens (`matchTokens` table) with anti-cheat validation: token signature, max points cap, expiration
- Idempotency on all point awards (`pointsAwards.idempotencyKey` unique constraint)
- Server-side scoring only — client never calculates points
- Minimum answer time for Daily 5 (15 seconds)

---

## 9. Wallet, Ledger, and Points Accounting

### Wallet Table
Each user has one wallet (`wallets` table):
- `balance` — current available PackPTS
- `lifetimeEarned` — total PackPTS ever earned
- `lifetimeSpent` — total PackPTS ever spent
- `status` — `active`, `frozen`, `suspended`

### Ledger (Append-Only)
Every point change is recorded in `ledgerEntries`:
- `entryType`: EARN, SPEND, ADJUST, PURCHASE_CREDIT, REVERSAL, STREAK_EARN, EXPIRE
- `source`: gameplay, purchase, admin, redemption, adjustment, streak
- `amount`: positive for credits, negative for debits
- `balanceAfter`: wallet balance after this entry
- `idempotencyKey`: unique — prevents duplicate entries
- `refType` + `refId`: links to source record (match, purchase, redemption, etc.)
- `metadata`: JSON for additional context

### FIFO Point Buckets
Points are tracked by source and expiration in `packptsBucket`:
- `sourceType`: EARNED, PURCHASED, BONUS, ADJUSTMENT
- `originalAmount` / `remainingAmount`: bucket balance
- `expiresAt`: when points expire
- `status`: OPEN, DEPLETED, EXPIRED

When points are spent, the `packptsSpendAllocation` table records which buckets were drawn from (FIFO — oldest first).

### Expiration Policy
Configurable in `packptsExpirationPolicy`:
- Earned points: 365 days to expire (default)
- Bonus points: 90 days to expire (default)
- Purchased points: no expiration by default
- Grace period: 7 days
- Inactivity clawback: disabled by default (configurable)

### Liability Snapshots
`packptsLiabilitySnapshot` records daily accounting snapshots:
- Total outstanding points by source type
- Aging buckets (0-30d, 31-90d, 91-180d, 181-365d, 366+)
- Breakage estimate (default 25%)
- Used for financial reporting and risk monitoring

### Fraud Holds
- Wallet `status` can be `frozen` or `suspended` by admin or risk pipeline.
- `walletService.earn()` checks `isUserFrozen()` before awarding any points.
- Risk state tracked in `userRiskState` table.
- Frozen wallets cannot earn, spend, or redeem.

### What Exists vs. What's Needed
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Wallet with balance tracking | ✅ Implemented |
| Append-only ledger | ✅ Implemented |
| Idempotency on all entries | ✅ Implemented |
| FIFO bucket expiration | ✅ Implemented + scheduled. `server/services/expirationEngine.ts` (`runExpirationJob()` and `runInactivityExpiration()`); admin endpoint `POST /api/admin/expiration/run`; standalone script `server/jobs/runExpiration.ts`. Daily date-based run wired into pgJobQueue via `scheduleRecurringJob('packpts_expiration', …)` in `server/index.ts`, runs at `EXPIRATION_RUN_HOUR_UTC` (default 6 UTC = 1 AM EST). Set `EXPIRATION_ENABLED=false` to disable. Inactivity expiration is not yet on a recurring schedule. |
| Liability snapshots | ✅ Schema exists |
| Chargeback reversal | ⚠️ Schema supports it (REVERSAL entry type), but automated Stripe chargeback → reversal flow needs verification |
| Multi-currency support | ❌ Not implemented (USD only) |
| Real-time balance websocket push | ❌ Not implemented |

---

## 10. Payments and PackPTS Purchases

### Stripe Integration (Implemented)
- **Client:** `stripeClient.ts` configures Stripe with live/test key switching based on `APP_ENV` or `NODE_ENV`.
- **Checkout flow:** `POST /api/checkout` creates a Stripe Checkout Session → user redirected to Stripe → webhook `checkout.session.completed` processes fulfillment.
- **Webhook handling:** `POST /api/stripe/webhook` verifies signature, processes events. `purchaseEvents` table stores all webhook events with idempotent `eventId`.
- **Products:** Stored in `products` table with `stripePriceId` linking to Stripe. Types: CONSUMABLE (point bundles), ENTITLEMENT, SUBSCRIPTION.
- **Subscriptions:** `subscriptionProducts` table, monthly/yearly billing, Stripe recurring.
- **Customer mapping:** `stripeCustomers` table links users to Stripe customer IDs.
- **Checkout sessions:** `stripeCheckoutSessions` tracks session lifecycle (CREATED → PAID / CANCELED / EXPIRED).

### PackPTS Bundles (from products table / productMap)
Env-var-configured Stripe price IDs:
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PACKPTS_500` — 500 PackPTS bundle
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PACKPTS_1500` — 1,500 PackPTS bundle
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PACKPTS_6000` — 6,000 PackPTS bundle
- Monthly subscriptions: 500, 2000, 5000 PackPTS/month
- Pro and Legend tiers with entitlements

### Store Fee Profiles
`storeFeeProfiles` table tracks per-channel fee structures:
- `web_stripe`: 2.9% + $0.30
- `ios_iap`: platform fee rate (30% Apple)
- `android_iap`: platform fee rate

### Margin Guardrails
Products have `guardrailsStatus` (PASS, WARN, BLOCK, OVERRIDE) and `guardrailsJson` computed from `profitPolicy`:
- Minimum margin: 25% (default `minMarginM`)
- PackPTS value: $0.002 per point (default `packptsValueVMicrousd` = 2000)
- Ratio tracking: `ratioUsdPerPackptMicro` / `ratioPackptPerUsdMicro` per product

### iOS In-App Purchase (Planned/Partially Implemented)
- `appleTransactions` table stores verified IAP receipts
- `POST /api/purchases/verify-apple` endpoint exists for server-side receipt verification
- StoreKit 2 integration planned for native iOS app (see iOS Adaptation Plan)
- Apple's 30% fee factored into `storeFeeProfiles`

### What Must Be Tested Before Launch
- Stripe webhook idempotency (replay same event → no duplicate credit)
- Checkout session expiration handling
- Subscription renewal and cancellation
- Chargeback handling (disputed payment → point reversal)
- Product guardrail enforcement (block sale if margin < threshold)
- Test/live key switching

## 11. Marketplace and Affiliate Commerce

### Purpose
The PackPTS Marketplace lets users spend earned or purchased PackPTS toward real trading cards listed on eBay and Goldin Auctions. PackPTS acts as a discount/credit — users still pay the remaining balance in USD via the external marketplace.

### How It Works
1. User plays games → earns PackPTS → visits `/marketplace`.
2. Marketplace shows listings from eBay and Goldin, contextually matched to the user's recent gameplay (card sets, players, teams, years).
3. User selects a listing → system calculates maximum redeemable PackPTS based on profit policy.
4. `externalPurchaseIntent` is created with: listing price, computed max redemption (`computedRmax`), requested PackPTS spend.
5. On approval, `redemptionCredit` is issued: PackPTS deducted from wallet, credit token generated.
6. User clicks through affiliate link to complete purchase on eBay/Goldin.

### Affiliate Integration
**eBay Partner Network (EPN):**
- Outbound links built with EPN tracking parameters: `campId`, `customIdPrefix`, `mkcid`, `mksid`
- `GET /out/ebay/:listingId` generates signed outbound URL with HMAC token (1-hour expiry)
- Click tracking in `outboundClicks` table (source, listing, user, IP hash, referrer, page path, card context)

**Goldin Auctions:**
- Admin-curated listings only (`goldinCuratedListings` table) — no live API integration, and none is planned
- Listings are manually managed by admin with end-time countdown display

**Marketplace caching:** `marketplaceCache` table caches search results per source with TTL.

### Margin Rules
`profitPolicy` table (versioned, time-effective):
- `minMarginM`: 25% minimum margin on any redemption
- `affiliateRateA`: 2% (eBay affiliate commission)
- `affiliateHaircutH`: 70% (what % of affiliate revenue funds redemptions)
- `packptsValueVMicrousd`: $0.002 per PackPTS

`marketplaceMarginConfig` table allows per-source overrides (eBay vs. Goldin haircut rates).

### Redemption Flow
1. `POST /api/redemption/calculate` — estimate PackPTS → USD value for a given listing
2. `POST /api/redeem` — execute redemption (minimum 1,000 PackPTS; admin review required if USD value ≥ threshold)
3. `redemptionCredit` record created → wallet debited via ledger → credit token generated
4. `POST /api/redemption/validate-token` / `consume-token` — verify and apply credit

### ⚠️ Affiliate Attribution Warning
Affiliate redirect URLs and marketplace links MUST preserve tracking parameters. Any change to outbound URL construction, the `/out/ebay/:listingId` route, or the EPN parameter assembly must be tested to confirm affiliate attribution is not broken. Lost attribution = lost revenue.

---

## 12. Matchmaking and 1v1 Gameplay

### Architecture
- **Lobbies:** Created via REST (`POST /api/lobby/create`), joined via join code. Stored in `lobbies` table.
- **Matches:** Created when host starts game. Stored in `matches` table with full lifecycle: LOBBY → INITIALIZING → ACTIVE → FINISHED / CANCELLED.
- **Battle Sessions:** `battleSessions` table tracks multi-match series between two players (wins, losses, ties, rematch flow).
- **Participants:** `matchParticipants` table tracks each player's state in a match (score, correctAnswers, connection status, last seen).
- **Questions:** `matchQuestions` table stores per-match card assignments with point values and seed versioning.
- **Answers:** `matchAnswers` table with unique constraint on (matchId, userId, idx) preventing double-submission.

### WebSocket Flow
1. Client connects to `/ws`, authenticates via session cookie or `auth` message.
2. **Queue:** `join_queue` → server pairs two users → creates lobby + match → sends `match_found`.
3. **Lobby:** `join_lobby` → `set_lobby_card_set` → `start_match` (host only).
4. **Match:** `submit_answer` → server validates, records, broadcasts → `ready_next` → next question or finish.
5. **Rematch:** `rematch_vote` (both must accept) → new match in same battle session.

### Card Selection
- Cards drawn from `playableCards` filtered by the selected `gameSet`.
- Previously used cards in a match tracked in `matchUsedCards` to avoid repeats.
- If a card's image fails, `question_replace_request` triggers server-side replacement (tracked via `replacedCount` on `matchQuestions`).

### Disconnect Handling
- **Heartbeat:** Clients send periodic heartbeats; server tracks `isConnected` and `lastSeenAt` on participants.
- **Lobby disconnect:** Host gets 30-second grace period to reconnect; guest disconnecting immediately removes them.
- **Match disconnect:** 60-second grace period, after which the disconnected player auto-forfeits.
- **Battle session disconnect:** Immediate end, no reconnect.

### Fairness
- Both players see identical questions in the same order.
- Answer submissions are timestamped server-side.
- Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire answer spam (3 per 2 seconds).
- Match tokens provide anti-cheat validation.

### Daily Quotas
`dailyQuotas` table tracks matches started/completed per user per day per mode. Configurable limits can be enforced to prevent match grinding.

### Known Issues
- No ELO-based matchmaking filtering (schema exists, logic not wired to queue)
- No AI fallback opponent if queue is empty
- Wager settlement logic may be incomplete

## 13. User Accounts and Authentication

> **Verified 2026-06-14 (Plan Prompt 5)** — auth surface audited end-to-end after the OIDC purge. No dead references to the removed third-party provider remain in `server/`, `client/`, or `shared/`. Local-credential and WorkOS paths are both wired. E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` (signup → /api/friends gate → logout → re-login → forgot-password) runs green against production.

### Implemented Auth Methods

**Local Auth (Primary) — verified green:**
- Registration: `POST /api/auth/register` — username, email, password (bcrypt hashed in `localCredentials` table); rate-limited; sets `req.session.localUserId`; issues 250 PackPTS welcome bonus
- Login: `POST /api/auth/local-login` — `usernameOrEmail` + password → express-session; rate-limited (5/15min)
- Logout: `POST /api/auth/local-logout`
- Password reset: `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` → token email → `GET /api/auth/validate-reset-token?token=…` → `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
- Magic-link account linking: `/api/auth/link/{challenge,confirm,send-magic,verify,cancel}`
- Sessions stored in PostgreSQL via `sessions` table (sid, sess JSONB, expire)
- Session management: Passport.js with local strategy
- Canonical guard: `server/auth/middleware.ts:isAuthenticated` returns `{ message: "Unauthorized" }` on 401 (no internals)
- Session inspector: `GET /api/auth/user`

**WorkOS OAuth (SSO) — wired, package installed:**
- `WORKOS_API_KEY` + `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` configure OIDC flow (`@workos-inc/node`)
- Routes: `GET /api/auth/workos/start`, `GET /api/auth/workos/callback`, `POST /api/auth/workos/logout`
- Client trigger: `client/src/pages/auth.tsx` "Continue with WorkOS" button posts to `/api/auth/workos/start`
- Maps to `userIdentities` table (provider: "workos", providerUserId, email); enum allowlist in `shared/schema.ts:identityProviders` = `["local", "workos"]`
- Email collision handling via `pendingLinkChallenges` (magic link verification)
- Sets `req.session.workosUserId`

**iOS JWT Auth:**
- `POST /api/auth/token` — exchange email/password for JWT access token (15-min) + refresh token (30-day)
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` — rotate refresh token
- `POST /api/auth/apple` — Sign in with Apple identity token verification
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — JWT logout
- Refresh tokens stored in `refreshTokens` table with device hint and revocation tracking

### User Model
Key fields on `users` table:
- `status`: PENDING → ACTIVE (after invite/cap check) or WAITLISTED or BANNED
- `isAdmin`: boolean for admin dashboard access
- `deviceFingerprint`, `lastSignupIp`: fraud signals
- `points`, `gamesPlayed`, `correctAnswers`, `totalAnswers`: aggregate stats

### Access Control
- **Founders Cap:** `activeUserCounter` table enforces maximum active users. New signups beyond the cap go to waitlist.
- **Invite Codes:** `inviteCodes` table with max uses, expiration. Required during capped signup.
- **Founders Pass:** Viral invite system — existing users can issue passes (`foundersPass` table) that let new users bypass the cap.
- **Waitlist:** `waitlistEntries` with position, referral tracking, status progression.

### Security
- Rate limiting on login (5 attempts per 15 minutes) and registration
- Password reset via email token (`passwordResetTokens` table, expiring)
- Identity linking audit trail (`identityLinkAudit` table)
- Access audit log (`accessAuditLog` table) tracks every activation, invite, and abuse event

---

## 14. Admin, Operations, and Content Management

### Admin Dashboard
All admin routes require `isAdmin: true`. Admin UI lives at `/admin/*` with 20+ pages.

**Implemented Admin Features:**
- **Dashboard:** KPIs (total users, games played, points awarded, card stats), top players chart
- **User Management:** Search/filter users by status, view detailed analytics per user, adjust wallet, freeze/unfreeze accounts, approve waitlisted users
- **Card Management:** Import card sets from CardHedge, configure mask regions, review reported cards, view card telemetry (wrong-answer rates), manage quarantine status, rotate images
- **Card Sets:** Create/edit game sets, configure CardHedge import queries, manage active/inactive sets
- **Redemption Management:** View pending/approved/rejected redemptions, approve/reject/reverse, manage redemption tiers
- **Streak Management:** View streak stats, configure reward schedules, force-freeze user streaks, manually adjust streak counts
- **Products/Store:** CRUD for PackPTS bundles and subscriptions, margin guardrail status
- **Access Control:** Manage founders cap, create invite codes, manage waitlist, invite from waitlist
- **Founders Pass:** View all passes, deactivate individual or all passes
- **Geo Analytics:** Geographic user distribution, session data by country/region
- **Growth Agent:** Content generation management, social media posting controls
- **Audit Log:** Searchable log of all admin actions with metadata
- **Panic Controls:** Emergency switches to disable purchases, PvP, or specific card sets

**Missing Admin Features (Needed):**
- Manual fraud review queue (risk signals exist but no admin UI for reviewing them)
- Marketplace margin override UI
- Automated chargeback → wallet freeze flow
- Batch card import validation preview
- A/B test results dashboard (post analytics visible in growth admin, but no dedicated A/B test comparison view)
- Discord/Reddit/Instagram publisher configuration UI

### 14a. Growth Agent & Social Media System

PackPTS has two complementary growth automation systems, plus a growth flywheel analytics layer.

#### System 1: Growth Agent (Manual/Triggered)

**Location:** `server/services/growthAgent/`
**Entry point:** `POST /api/admin/growth/trigger` or admin dashboard
**Purpose:** Generate daily content plans + per-platform content items via OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)

Pipeline:
1. `planGenerator.ts` — Calls OpenAI to generate daily themes, goals, and platform targets
2. `contentGenerator.ts` — Generates per-platform content items (TikTok scripts, Instagram captions, X tweets, Reddit posts)
3. `index.ts` — Orchestrates the above, writes to `growth_content_plans` + `growth_content_items`, queues drafts into `publishing_queue`

Platform-specific flags: `GROWTH_TIKTOK_ENABLED`, `GROWTH_INSTAGRAM_ENABLED`, `GROWTH_X_ENABLED`, `GROWTH_REDDIT_ENABLED`

Items in the `publishing_queue` are designed for **manual posting** by an operator (or future auto-publisher). Admin UI at `/admin/growth` provides mark-posted and mark-skipped actions.

#### System 2: Social Media Agent (Autonomous)

**Location:** `server/services/socialMedia/`
**Toggle:** `SOCIAL_MEDIA_AGENT_ENABLED=true`
**Purpose:** Fully autonomous content generation, image composition, A/B testing, publishing, analytics, and prompt evolution

Startup (`index.ts`):
1. Verify DB connectivity (hard fail)
2. Verify CardHedge API (soft fail — per-post degradation)
3. Verify Twitter credentials (soft fail)
4. Verify TikTok credentials (soft fail)
5. Seed campaign rewards if empty
6. Recover stuck PUBLISHING posts to QUEUED
7. Audit and block orphaned QUEUED posts missing media
8. Start all 4 scheduler loops

**Scheduler Loops (all in-process):**

| Loop | Interval | Fires At | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| Prompt Evolution | 5 min check | 1 AM EST (daily) | Read A/B test winners → OpenAI → generate next-gen copy variants |
| Daily Queue Builder | 5 min check | 2 AM EST (daily) | Build 2-4 posts per platform per day, alternate acquisition/retention campaigns |
| Publisher | 60 sec | Continuous | Pick up QUEUED posts with scheduledAt <= now, publish to Twitter/TikTok |
| Analytics Fetcher | 6 hours | Continuous | Fetch post metrics, trigger A/B test analysis |

**Content Generation (`contentGenerator.ts`):**
- 7 content types: TRIVIA_CARD, LEADERBOARD_HIGHLIGHT, STREAK_MILESTONE, MARKET_PRICE_SPOTLIGHT, NEW_USER_ACQUISITION, REWARD_ANNOUNCEMENT, CHALLENGE
- 3 A/B variants (A/B/C) per content type, rotated by day
- Context enrichment: queries live DB for user counts, streak records, top scores, active reward values
- Fallback templates when OPENAI_API_KEY is not set

**Publishers:**
- Twitter (`publisher/twitter.ts`): Full auto-publish with image upload via twitter-api-v2
- TikTok (`publisher/tiktok.ts`): Photo post via TikTok Content Publishing API, token auto-refresh
- Discord: **Not implemented** (webhook URL env var defined in docs but no publisher code)
- Reddit: **Not implemented** (env vars defined in strategy docs but no publisher code)
- Instagram: **Not implemented** (env var defined but no publisher code)

**Safety Systems:**
- Fact Checker (`factChecker.ts`): Verifies user counts, match counts, scores, streaks, reward values against DB. Auto-corrects claims >10% off actual values.
- Preflight Validator (`preflight.ts`): Blocks posts referencing visual content without attached media image.
- Startup Audit: Blocks orphaned QUEUED posts missing media.
- Crash Recovery: Resets PUBLISHING posts to QUEUED on startup.
- Rate Limit Tracking: Twitter publisher tracks remaining rate limit.
- Retry Logic: 3 attempts per post with 30-minute backoff.
- A/B Test Timeout: Marks inconclusive after 7 days.

**Prompt Evolution (`promptEvolution.ts`):**
- Reads concluded A/B tests from last 30 days
- Loads `prompt_program.md` (human-editable research direction file)
- Calls OpenAI to generate next-generation copy variants
- Writes to `evolved_copy_variants` table
- `contentGenerator` loads active evolved variants in preference to hardcoded copy
- Each generation learns from the prior generation's winners

**Campaigns:**
- `newUserAcquisition.ts`: Acquisition-focused content type rotation, runs on even-numbered days
- `retention.ts`: Retention-focused content type rotation, runs on odd-numbered days

**Image Composition:**
- `imageComposer.ts` → `gameImageRenderer.ts`: Renders card images with branding overlay
- `imageStorage.ts`: Uploads composed images to Cloudflare R2
- Falls back to local storage if R2 is unavailable

#### Growth Flywheel Analytics

**Location:** `server/services/growthFlywheel/rollup.ts`
**Trigger:** `POST /api/admin/growth/flywheel/compute` (admin API)

Computes daily aggregates from gameplay events, Daily 5 entries, share events, referral links, and referral attributions. Writes to:
- `global_growth_rollups`: DAU, matches played, Daily 5 entries, shares, invites, signups from invites, k-factor
- `user_growth_rollups`: Per-user daily metrics (same dimensions)

Idempotent — safe to re-run for the same day.

#### Growth Database Tables

| Table | System | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `growth_content_plans` | Growth Agent | Daily AI-generated content plans |
| `growth_content_items` | Growth Agent | Per-platform content items from plans |
| `publishing_queue` | Growth Agent | Manual posting queue with Notion sync |
| `growth_job_runs` | Growth Agent | Job execution log with timing and errors |
| `social_posts` | Social Media Agent | Auto-posting queue + history |
| `post_analytics` | Social Media Agent | Per-post performance metrics (impressions, likes, shares, clicks) |
| `ab_tests` | Social Media Agent | A/B test tracking (RUNNING, CONCLUDED, INCONCLUSIVE) |
| `evolved_copy_variants` | Social Media Agent | Prompt evolution output (active copy variants) |
| `campaign_rewards` | Social Media Agent | Campaign reward config (signup bonus, streak rewards) |
| `global_growth_rollups` | Flywheel | DAU, matches, shares, k-factor by day |
| `user_growth_rollups` | Flywheel | Per-user daily growth metrics |
| `share_events` | Flywheel | Content sharing/viral tracking |

#### Known Gaps

1. **Missing publishers:** Discord, Reddit, and Instagram publishers are referenced in strategy docs but no code exists. Discord (webhook) is the easiest to implement.
2. **No global circuit breaker:** Strategy docs describe "5 failures in 30 min → pause 30 min" but code only has per-post retry logic.
3. **Diversity tracking is in-memory:** Resets on server restart. Should be DB-backed for production reliability.
4. **Daily 5 announcements not wired:** Strategy calls for 8 AM ET announcement and 9 PM ET recap posts. These are not integrated into the Social Media Agent scheduler.
5. **Brand rules validator not implemented:** Strategy describes a "second AI pass" for compliance validation. Only the DB fact-checker exists.

## 15. Fraud, Risk, and Abuse Prevention

### Threat Model

| Threat | Vector | Current Mitigation | Gap |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----|
| **Gameplay botting** | Automated answer submission | Rate limiting (3 ans/2s), match tokens, minimum answer time (Daily 5) | No ML-based anomaly detection |
| **Multiple accounts** | Create many accounts to farm points | Device fingerprint tracking, IP tracking, founders cap | No automated multi-account detection |
| **Answer harvesting** | Inspect API/network to get correct answers | Server withholds correct answer until after submission | Must be continuously verified |
| **Payment fraud** | Stolen cards, chargebacks | Stripe handles card verification; `purchaseEvents` idempotency | Automated chargeback → freeze not confirmed |
| **Referral abuse** | Self-referral, fake accounts | Referral tracking, device/IP logging | No automated referral fraud detection |
| **Redemption abuse** | Redeem points from fraudulent purchases | Wallet freeze, admin review threshold, minimum redemption (1,000 pts) | Hold periods not fully implemented |
| **Collusion** | Two players sharing answers in 1v1 | Both see same questions simultaneously | No pattern detection for coordinated answers |
| **Device manipulation** | Factory reset to create new accounts | `deviceFingerprint` tracking | No device-level ban enforcement |
| **Marketplace manipulation** | Inflate listing prices to extract more redemption value | `profitPolicy` margin floor, per-source affiliate rates | No listing price validation against market data |

### Risk Pipeline (Implemented Schema, Partially Implemented Logic)
- **Event logging:** `authEvents`, `deviceEvents`, `paymentEvents`, `redemptionEvents`, `gameplayEvents` tables capture signals
- **Rollups:** `userRollup24h`, `deviceRollup24h`, `ipRollup24h` aggregate suspicious activity
- **Risk state:** `userRiskState` per user (NORMAL, UNDER_REVIEW, FROZEN)
- **Risk jobs:** `riskJobs` table for background processing
- **Risk suppression:** `riskSuppressions` for false-positive management
- **Feature flag:** `RISK_PIPELINE_ENABLED` (defaults to true)

### What Must Be Added
1. **Automated risk scoring** — consume rollup data → compute risk score → auto-freeze high-risk accounts
2. **Hold periods** — purchased points should have a cooldown before becoming redeemable (e.g., 72 hours)
3. **Velocity checks** — flag unusual patterns (many redemptions in short period, sudden point spikes)
4. **Admin review queue** — UI for reviewing flagged accounts with risk context
5. **Chargeback webhook handler** — Stripe `charge.disputed` → auto-freeze wallet → create REVERSAL ledger entry
6. **Device-level banning** — block known fraudulent device fingerprints from creating new accounts

## 17. Frontend Architecture

### Routing
- **Library:** Wouter (lightweight client-side router)
- **Split loading:** Critical paths (Home, Auth) are eagerly imported; all other pages are lazy-loaded with React.lazy + Suspense
- **Route guards:** `ProtectedRoute` component checks auth/admin status, redirects to `/auth` if unauthorized
- **Layout:** `AppShell` wraps all pages with Header and MobileNav (hidden on fullscreen game/match routes)

### Pages (30+)
Public: `/`, `/game/:mode`, `/lobby`, `/match/:matchId`, `/queue`, `/daily5`, `/leaderboard`, `/marketplace`, `/store`, `/auth`, `/waitlist`, `/invite`, `/redeem`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, `/creators`, `/partners`, `/roadmap`

Protected: `/profile`, `/friends`

Admin (20+): `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/users/:userId`, `/admin/metrics`, `/admin/audit-log`, `/admin/redemptions`, `/admin/tiers`, `/admin/streaks`, `/admin/daily5`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/subscriptions`, `/admin/access`, `/admin/geo`, `/admin/playable-sets`, `/admin/card-sets`, `/admin/cardhedge-card`, `/admin/card-search`, `/admin/card-reports`, `/admin/card-telemetry`, `/admin/package-guardrails`, `/admin/growth`

### Data Fetching
- **TanStack React Query v5** for all server state
- `apiRequest(method, path, body)` utility in `lib/queryClient.ts`
- Stale times: auth = 5 minutes, wallet = 30 seconds (60s refetch interval), leaderboard = varies
- UTM parameter capture in sessionStorage for attribution

### Card Display Components
- `GameCard.tsx` — Main card component with masking, image validation, placeholder detection, rotation, skip/replace logic
- `MaskedCardImage.tsx` — Canvas-based masking engine with configurable blur/pixelate regions per card set
- Image validation: color diversity analysis and dominant-color percentage detection to catch blank/silhouette placeholders

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 with custom HSL color variables
- Dark/light mode via class-based toggle (`ThemeProvider`)
- shadcn/ui component library (50+ Radix UI primitives)
- Custom design tokens: border-radius (lg: 9px, md: 6px, sm: 3px)
- Animations via Framer Motion (card reveals, point awards, leaderboard updates) — all < 500ms

---

## 18. Backend Architecture

### Express App Structure
Entry point: `server/index.ts`

**Startup sequence:**
1. Environment validation (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET required)
2. CORS middleware with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
3. JSON body parsing (with raw body capture for Stripe webhooks)
4. Request ID injection + structured logging (PII sanitized)
5. Static file serving
6. Auth setup (express-session → PostgreSQL store, Passport)
7. Route registration (game, match, lobby, daily5, wallet, admin, marketplace, friends, referrals, CardHedge, iOS, health, growth)
8. WebSocket server setup on `/ws`
9. Background jobs: risk pipeline, image validation (6h), card pool refresh (12h), session cleanup (1h), match cleanup (1h), redemption cleanup (1h)

### Middleware
- `rateLimiter.ts` — Per-endpoint rate limits (login: 5/15min, registration, answer submission: 3/2s, checkout)
- `geoMiddleware.ts` — IP-based geolocation (IPInfo API), privacy-preserving IP hashing, VPN detection
- `gameGuards.ts` — Quota and entitlement validation before game start
- `requestLogger.ts` — Structured request logging with request IDs, PII redaction

### Key API Groups
- **Auth:** `/api/auth/*` — register, login, logout, password reset, WorkOS OAuth, iOS JWT
- **Game:** `/api/game/*` — start session, answer, next question, replace card
- **Daily5:** `/api/daily5/*` — start, answer, finish, status, leaderboard
- **Lobby/Match:** `/api/lobby/*` — create, join, leave (REST); match lifecycle via WebSocket
- **Wallet:** `/wallet` — balance + history; `/api/wager/validate`
- **Redemption:** `/api/redemption/*` + `/api/redeem` — tiers, calculate, execute, history, token validation
- **Streak:** `/api/streak` — state, buy freeze, config
- **Marketplace:** `/api/marketplace/*` — search listings; `/out/ebay/:listingId` — affiliate redirect
- **Store:** `/api/checkout` — Stripe checkout; `/api/stripe/webhook` — payment webhooks
- **Admin:** `/api/admin/*` — 40+ endpoints for dashboard, users, cards, redemptions, streaks, products, access, geo, growth, panic
- **Friends:** Friend list management, match invites
- **Referrals:** `/api/referrals/*` — create, attribute, stats, leaderboard
- **Health:** `/api/health`, `/api/version`

### WebSocket Server
- Upgrade path: `/ws`
- Origin validation against `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- Session resolution from cookies
- Message types: auth, heartbeat, join_lobby, leave_lobby, start_match, join_match, join_queue, leave_queue, submit_answer, ready_next, match_resync, question_replace_request, rematch_vote, leave_match, battle_rematch_request, battle_leave, set_lobby_card_set
- Broadcast functions: `broadcastToLobby()`, `broadcastToMatch()`, `sendToUser()`

### Error Handling
- Centralized Express error handler
- `errorMonitor.expressErrorHandler()` for exception tracking
- Sentry integration available (`SENTRY_DSN` env var)
- Panic service for emergency system-wide disables

## 20. Environment Variables and Secrets

> **Production secret enforcement**: `server/utils/secretsCheck.ts` runs at startup. In `NODE_ENV=production` or `APP_ENV=production`, the server exits with a fatal error if any secret marked ✗ REQUIRED is missing **or** equals its known development default. In development the same check fires as loud warnings. Secret values are never printed in logs — only presence/absence.

## 22. Data Integrity and Idempotency Rules

### Where Idempotency Is Required and Implemented

| Operation | Idempotency Key | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Ledger entries (wallet) | `ledgerEntries.idempotencyKey` | Unique constraint; duplicate insert → conflict → no-op |
| Points awards | `pointsAwards.idempotencyKey` | Unique constraint |
| Streak claims | `streakClaimLog.idempotencyKey` | Unique constraint |
| Match answers | `matchAnswers(matchId, userId, idx)` | Unique constraint |
| Stripe webhooks | `purchaseEvents.eventId` | Unique constraint; same event ID → ignored |
| Apple IAP | `appleTransactions.transactionId` | Unique constraint |
| Redemptions | `rewardRedemptions.ledgerIdempotencyKey` | Generated from userId + amount + clientKey |

### Race Condition Prevention
- `redemptionReservations` table with ACTIVE/RELEASED/CONSUMED status prevents concurrent redemptions from over-spending margin
- Wallet operations use database transactions with row-level locking
- Answer submission uses async mutex per game session
- `activeUserCounter` uses atomic increment for cap enforcement

### Double-Spend Prevention
- Wallet balance is updated in the same transaction as the ledger entry creation
- FIFO bucket `remainingAmount` is decremented atomically during spend allocation
- `balanceAfter` on ledger entries creates an audit chain

### What Must Be Maintained
- **Never** update wallet balance without creating a corresponding ledger entry
- **Never** process a Stripe webhook without checking `purchaseEvents` for duplicate `eventId`
- **Never** award points without a unique `idempotencyKey`
- **Never** complete a redemption without a reservation check
- Match conclusion must be idempotent (re-finishing an already-finished match = no-op)

---

## 23. Testing Strategy

### Existing Tests
- **Playwright E2E:** `tests/` directory with end-to-end tests. Run via `npm run test:e2e`.
- **Vitest:** Dev dependency installed (`vitest 4.0.16`), but there is no meaningful unit test suite. This is a known gap.

### Required Tests (Proposed)

**Card Masking (Critical):**
- Verify no API response for a question includes the correct answer before submission
- Verify DOM inspection cannot reveal the player name
- Verify mask regions fully cover name text for each active card set
- Verify card replacement preserves masking

**Scoring:**
- Verify fame-based point calculation matches policy
- Verify vintage and rarity multipliers apply correctly
- Verify daily cap enforcement
- Verify per-match cap enforcement

**Wallet / Ledger:**
- Verify ledger idempotency (same key → no duplicate entry)
- Verify wallet balance matches sum of ledger entries
- Verify frozen wallet cannot earn or spend
- Verify FIFO bucket depletion order

**Payments:**
- Verify Stripe webhook idempotency (replay → no duplicate credit)
- Verify checkout session expiration handling
- Verify product guardrail enforcement (margin < threshold → block)

**Matchmaking:**
- Verify both players see identical questions
- Verify answer uniqueness constraint
- Verify disconnect grace period and auto-forfeit
- Verify battle session series tracking

**Marketplace:**
- Verify affiliate URL parameters are preserved
- Verify redemption margin calculation matches profit policy
- Verify minimum redemption enforcement
- Verify outbound click logging

**Fraud:**
- Verify rate limiting on answer submission
- Verify match token validation
- Verify minimum answer time enforcement (Daily 5)
- Verify frozen user cannot access game endpoints

## 24. Deployment and Local Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env  # (or create .env with DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET)

# Push schema to local PostgreSQL
npm run db:push

# Start development server (frontend + backend)
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default. Vite proxies the frontend through Express.

### Package Scripts
| Script | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `dev` | `NODE_ENV=development tsx server` | Start dev server with hot reload |
| `build` | `npm run check && tsx script/build.ts` | Type-check (gate) then build for production (output: dist/) |
| `start` | `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.cjs` | Run production build |
| `check` | `tsc` (with `noEmit: true` in tsconfig) | TypeScript type checking; required gate for `build` |
| `db:push` | `drizzle-kit push` | Sync schema to database |
| `test:e2e` | `playwright test` | Run end-to-end tests |
| `agent:social` | Social media posting service | Autonomous content generation |

**Build gate:** `npm run build` runs `tsc` first and refuses to bundle if there are any type errors. Railway invokes `npm run build` on every deploy, so a type error blocks production. Fix type errors at the root cause — do not cast to `any` or add `@ts-ignore`.

### Production Deployment (Railway)
- **Project:** `marvelous-freedom`
- **Auto-deploy:** `git push main` triggers Railway build and deploy
- **Railway CLI:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/railway` (authenticated)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL service on Railway, `DATABASE_URL` injected at runtime

### Running Migrations Against Production
```bash
# Get the public DB URL from Railway Postgres service
railway variables --service Postgres --json | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL'])"

# Run a SQL migration file
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libpq/18.1_1/bin/psql "<DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL>" -f migrations/<file>.sql

# Or push full schema via Drizzle
railway variables --service Postgres --json | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL'])" | \
  xargs -I{} sh -c 'DATABASE_URL="{}" npm run db:push'
```

**⚠️ Always run migrations immediately after pushing code that references new columns. The app will 500 on any query touching a column not yet in production.**

### API Version Canary
Hit `GET /api/version` after deploy to confirm new code is live before testing.

## 25. Known Bugs, Gaps, and Risks

### Gameplay
- [ ] No ELO-based matchmaking (schema exists, not wired to queue logic)
- [ ] No AI fallback opponent when queue is empty
- [ ] Wager match settlement is still in progress (confirmed not complete)
- [ ] Adaptive difficulty (personalized card selection) not implemented
- [ ] Tournament mode not implemented (UI shows "coming soon")

### Security & Fraud
- [ ] No automated risk scoring engine (event logging exists, scoring/auto-action does not)
- [ ] No automated chargeback → wallet freeze flow
- [ ] No hold period on purchased points before redemption eligibility
- [ ] No multi-account detection automation
- [ ] No device-level banning
- [x] Default hash salts in code — `enforceProductionSecrets()` now fails fast in prod if defaults are present (Prompt 6, 2026-06-14)
- [x] `JWT_SECRET` dev fallback — `enforceProductionSecrets()` now fails fast in prod if JWT_SECRET equals the dev constant (Prompt 6, 2026-06-14)

### Payments
- [ ] Apple IAP receipt verification endpoint exists but full iOS payment flow untested in production
- [ ] Subscription renewal/cancellation webhook handling needs verification
- [ ] No automated refund processing

### Marketplace
- [ ] No listing price validation against market data (users could potentially manipulate)
- [ ] Goldin integration appears to use curated/manual listings vs. live API
- [ ] Redemption admin review queue exists but no notification system for pending reviews

### Data Model
- [ ] Two card tables exist: `baseballCards` is legacy/fallback only (not used for active gameplay); `playableCards` is the authoritative table. `baseballCards` is a deprecation candidate but fallback references remain in matchService, maskingService, and storage.
- [ ] Card masking regions must be configured per card set — new sets without masks will leak player names

### Testing
- [ ] No unit test suite exists (known gap; Vitest installed but no tests written)
- [x] FIFO bucket expiration job is scheduled via pgJobQueue (`packpts_expiration`) and runs daily at `EXPIRATION_RUN_HOUR_UTC` (default 6 UTC). Inactivity expiration still runs only via manual trigger / standalone script.
- [ ] No automated masking verification tests
- [ ] No load testing for WebSocket concurrent matches
- [ ] No payment webhook replay tests in CI

### Deployment
- [ ] Railway auto-deploy may not trigger reliably (see CLAUDE.md notes on webhook, manual redeploy)
- [ ] No staging environment documented
- [ ] No database backup/restore procedure documented

---

## 26. Non-Negotiable Product Rules

**Every future developer and AI agent must follow these rules. Violations can break the product, lose revenue, or enable fraud.**

- [ ] **NEVER leak the player name before answer submission** — in images, API responses, DOM, network, logs, filenames, alt text, or metadata
- [ ] **NEVER award points twice for the same event** — all point awards must use idempotency keys
- [ ] **NEVER process payment webhooks without idempotency** — check `purchaseEvents.eventId` before crediting
- [ ] **NEVER allow redemption of frozen or suspended wallet points** — check wallet status before any spend
- [ ] **NEVER break affiliate attribution** — outbound URLs must preserve EPN parameters; test after any change to marketplace routes
- [ ] **NEVER lower marketplace margin rules without explicit approval** — `profitPolicy.minMarginM` is a financial control
- [ ] **NEVER modify wallet logic without ledger-level accounting** — every balance change needs a ledger entry
- [ ] **NEVER assume card data is clean** — images may be broken, names may be wrong, masks may not cover properly
- [ ] **NEVER invent player or card metadata** — all card data comes from CardHedge or admin import
- [ ] **NEVER treat planned features as implemented** — check the codebase, not this document, for current state
- [ ] **NEVER use `await import()` for shared modules in server code** — static imports only (esbuild CJS breaks dynamic imports)
- [ ] **NEVER use static imports of native modules (sharp, ffmpeg) in route files** — lazy-import only to avoid server startup crashes
- [ ] **NEVER commit and push without `git pull --rebase` first** — prevents non-fast-forward rejections on Railway

---

## 27. Future Roadmap

### Immediate Fixes
- Wire ELO ratings to matchmaking queue (schema exists, needs logic)
- Implement automated chargeback → wallet freeze flow
- Add hold period on purchased points before redemption eligibility
- Ensure all production hash salts are non-default
- Build a unit test suite (Vitest installed, no tests written — start with masking, scoring, wallet, webhook idempotency)

### Near-Term Product Improvements
- Tournament mode (brackets, entry fees, prize pools)
- Pack-opening card-reveal animation experience
- AI fallback opponent for empty matchmaking queue
- Adaptive difficulty (ELO-based card selection per user)
- Push notification system (streak reminders, match invites, daily challenge)
- Enhanced onboarding flow with tutorial game

### Marketplace Expansion
- Live Goldin API integration (replace manual curation)
- Additional affiliate partners beyond eBay and Goldin
- Marketplace listing price validation against market data
- Enhanced search and filtering (by player, year, grade, price range)
- Purchase confirmation flow with PackPTS credit application

### Fraud / Risk Maturity
- Automated risk scoring engine consuming rollup data
- Admin fraud review queue with risk context
- Multi-account detection (device fingerprint + IP clustering)
- Velocity-based alerts (many redemptions, sudden point spikes)
- Device-level banning
- Machine-learning anomaly detection on answer patterns

### Mobile / App Store Readiness
- iOS native app (SwiftUI, 22-24 week plan documented in `iOS-Adaptation-Plan.md`)
- Apple IAP (StoreKit 2) for digital goods
- Sign in with Apple (required if WorkOS OAuth is offered)
- Haptic feedback, push notifications, WidgetKit
- Android app (no current plan documented)

### Long-Term Vision
- Expand beyond baseball: basketball, football, hockey, soccer cards (multi-sport card sets already in schema)
- Battle pass / seasonal content
- Social features: guilds/teams, spectator mode, live tournaments
- Creator partnerships (card artists, athletes)
- Physical card marketplace (not just affiliate — direct sales)
- Targeting Fanatics ecosystem acquisition at $1B valuation

## 28. Instructions for Future Claude Code Sessions

**Read this file before making any changes to PackPTS.**

1. **Read PACKPTS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first.** Understand the product, architecture, and constraints before touching code.

2. **Inspect the relevant code before editing.** This document describes intent and architecture. The codebase is the source of truth for current implementation.

3. **Update PACKPTS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md whenever you change:**
   - Product behavior or game modes
   - Database schema (new tables, columns, or migrations)
   - API routes (new endpoints or changed contracts)
   - Environment variables
   - Payment or marketplace logic
   - Fraud controls or risk pipeline
   - Core assumptions documented here

4. **Do not rely on memory alone.** Re-read relevant sections of this file and the actual code before making assumptions.

5. **Do not rewrite large areas unnecessarily.** Follow the Surgical Changes principle in CLAUDE.md. Touch only what you must.

6. **Preserve non-negotiable rules (Section 26).** Before any change to card display, answer payloads, wallet operations, payment webhooks, marketplace links, or scoring, verify the relevant rules are maintained.

7. **Before changing gameplay, verify:**
   - Masking still works (player name not leaked in any channel)
   - Scoring matches the reward policy
   - Daily/per-match caps are enforced
   - Answer idempotency is preserved

8. **Before changing payments, verify:**
   - Webhook idempotency (duplicate event → no duplicate credit)
   - Product guardrails (margin check passes)
   - Checkout session lifecycle is correct

9. **Before changing marketplace logic, verify:**
   - Affiliate attribution parameters are preserved in outbound URLs
   - Margin calculations match `profitPolicy`
   - Redemption reservation prevents race conditions

10. **At the end of any meaningful change, ask yourself:** Does PACKPTS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md need an update? If yes, update it in the same session.

11. **Use the API version canary** (`GET /api/version`) to confirm deploys before testing.

12. **Run `git pull --rebase` before committing and pushing.**

13. **Never use Replit for PackPTS.** The project is on Railway. Replit interaction will break things.
